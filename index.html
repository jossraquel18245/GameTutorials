    <h1>Arcade</h1>
    <h2>Artist statement: I always find that games are good destressors for me.
      Especially now with the Pandemic where we can't go out as much I can play
      games with my friends online. I wanted to create this game because eventhough
      it's not as complex as other games it's a fun little way to get entertained
      while being at home.</h2>

    <h2>The future goal with this page is to create other mini games within the page
    to have it be like a little Arcade. I think this would be fun to explore and
    have other types of games in. </h2>
